DESCRIPTION:
Slide Anything PRO is a premium addon plugin for the Slide Anything plugin which is available for FREE download on WordPress.org here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/slide-anything/
Slide Anything PRO adds Modal Popups to Slide Anything, and each slide can now be an IMAGE popup, a VIDEO EMBED popup (YouTube/Vimeo), a popup containing HTML CODE or a popup displaying a WordPress SHORTCODE.

- Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu within the WordPress Dashboard.
- Go to 'Slide Anything PRO' page within the WordPress 'Settings' menu

  (you should see a green 'ACTIVE' message once the plugin is activated)

USING SLIDE ANYTHING PRO:
- Once activated, when editing Slide Anything slides, click on the 'Slide Popup' tabs to create popups for each slide
- Select 'IMAGE', 'VIDEO' or 'HTML' for 'SA Popup Type', and the input fields within the 'Slide Popup' tab will change accordingly
