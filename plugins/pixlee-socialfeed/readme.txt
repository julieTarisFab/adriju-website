= Why Instagram Social Feed: = 

Social media is no longer just a marketing channel for brands-- It’s the way people communicate, discover products, and shop. 

By creating more social web experiences, and bridging the gap between social media and your own digital web presence, you can create a richer and more authentic experience for people on your website. 

At [Pixlee](https://www.pixlee.com/), we help brands connect social media and the content + stories their customers create, to form more memorable and engaging brand experiences. We specialize in content marketing that leverages user-generated content (UGC), and make it shoppable across in-brand channels such as web, email, mobile, and digital advertising. 

Our free Instagram Social Feed is a project we put together to help web owners of all shapes and sizes start using social more effectively across their website, before investing in an enterprise platform like Pixlee.
